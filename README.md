# music_genre_classifier


This project focuses on exploring over 40,000 different music tracks on Spotify, giving a detailed overview of the various relationships between features in the dataset. These insights are then used to train the computer to predict the genre of a given song, achieved through the implementation of numerous machine learning models. Each song in the dataset belongs to one of the following eight genres:

- Hip-Hop/Rap 
- Jazz
- Classical
- Electronic
- Anime/J-Pop
- Blues
- Country
- Rock
